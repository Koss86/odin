## Random Odin-lang code

This is just all the odin code I made while learning odin. Most of it is in prac/. 

hangman/ is, as the name suggest, a hangman game written in odin and raylib.

prac/snek has a more complete version of the snek game (A tutorial by [Karl Zylinski](https://zylinski.se)) with textures made by me.

prac/aoc is all the aoc puzzles I've done in odin.

And breakout/ is a started but incomplete game from another [Karl Zylinski](https://zylinski.se) tutorial.
